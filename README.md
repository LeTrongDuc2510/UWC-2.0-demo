# UWC 2.0 project
This project aims to develop a web-based application that facilitates the management of urban waste collection. The application provides an efficient and effective way to manage waste collection in a city or community, particularly in developing countries where waste management is often costly and ineffective.

## Constraints
There are some constraints to the development of UWC 2.0. There exists a current system UWC 1.0 with a database. UWC 2.0 is expected to import and to use the existing data from UWC 1.0. It is expected that the Task Management to be inter-operable with the UWC 1.0 as much as possible. The system should be able to handle real-time data from at least 1000 MCPs at the moment and 10.000 MCPs in five years. UWC 2.0 system interfaces should be in Vietnamese, with an opportunity to switch to English in the future.

## Getting Started
To view the application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The application will automatically load and be ready to use.
